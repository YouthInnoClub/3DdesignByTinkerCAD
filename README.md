# 3DdesignByTinkerCAD
3D design project and idea using TinkerCAD, all the projects was designed by our students in our Youth Innovation Club

We host our 3D design for beginner class since Fall 2017, then the same class repeat at Winter 2018.

Our students create lots of fantastic 3D modelling design, and we like to collect them together, and show their great efforts.
